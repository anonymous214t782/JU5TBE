     Get Smart is a really short(about 100-150 pages)
     that is filled (honestly for me somewhat useful).

      <span class="mc"> Main concepts </span>
   
  <span class= "point">
     •The Book preaches CONTINUOS LEARNING in order to 
      improve our capabilities (especially in a career

      the "top 1%" succeed.
  </span> 
  
  <span class= "point">
     •Having a positive/winner mindset and developing
      resilience are vital for overcoming eventual

     NO MORE,MR NICE GUY
    </span>
     A somewhat mistakenly controversial book about the
     y2k concept of nice guys.It brings to lite the
     common pitfalls (usually orchastrated by the nice
     guy) in their lives and how to fix it.
  
      <span class="mc"> Main concepts </span>
   
  <span class="point">
     •Nice guys use niceness (termed in the book as 
      covert contracts) to manipulate people in order
      to get their needs met (not so nice is it)
  </span> 
  
  <span class="point">
  • bonus(this means that they prioritise their needs
         last and hope that they will be met and 
         overreact when they aren't)
    
  </span> 
     
  <span class="point">
      •Nice guys feel as if they can directly ask for
     what they want which oftentimes leds to their 
     needs not met
  </span>
  
   <span class="point">
     • •Prioritising their needs first (being assertive)is actually an important part towards curing

    THE ART OF SEDUCTION

    This book basically teaches how to create attraction using basic principles designed to take 
    advantage pf our instincts(i might be painting it
    in a bad way,but it being controversial does not
    mean it isn't somewhat accurate)
    
    
    
    

      <span class="mc"> Main concepts </span>
   
  <span class= "point">
     •The most basic idea is that you have to choose
     a "target" that will be receptive (amazing,pick someone thats interested (or gullible...maybe..dont))
       
  </span> 
  
  <span class= "point">
     •Create skibidy sigma rizz as the youngins call it.
     basically be mysterios but not in a depressing way
     that way you kill them with curiosity or something
  </span> 
  
  <span class= "point">
     •Manipulate their emotions 🙂.....
     make them feel happy excited etc for the most part
     dont actually manipulate

     In this story narrative book are lessons on ways
     to improve decision making,Authored by a former
     US FIGHTER PILOT and Its concepts are widely
     used by the US Airforce (meaning they are mostly 
     legit (If its good enough for America's Military....))

      (essentially thinking in probabilities on steroids) frankly he can explain it better (look inside
      the material section ).
       
  </span> 
  
  <span class= "point">
     •The book prioritises creative thinking(moreso on the later parts) and goves a method called "conceptual
     learning" (learn the concepts,not the details) as a way of developing critical thinking.

  Atomic habits
 </span>
The book simplifies the science of habitual behaviour
and give practical advice in creating,maintaining and destroying habitual behavior,its text is easy to read and is easily understandable(if you understant its contents then you will understand the power of habits)
(from here onward i will just which book ties to which book).

<span class="mc">
  Main concepts
</span>

<span class="point">
  •Habits have a cue,routine,reward system
   (the cue is something that triggers the habit
   the routine is the habit,and the reward is what 
   you get out of the habit and also reinforces it)
</span>

<span class="point">
  •In order to create a habit it must have these three
   qualities,in order to destroy it you must 
   atleast remove one of these.
</span>

<span class="point">
  •the more you do a habit the more it is reinforced
