     This book is also nearly the same as Thinking fast

     A somewhat mistakenly controversial book about the

     common pitfalls (usually orchastrated by the nice
     guy) in their lives and how to fix it.
  
      <span class= "mc"> Main concepts </span>
   
  <span class= "point">
     •Nice guys use niceness (termed in the book as 
      covert contracts) to manipulate people in order
      to get their needs met (not so nice is it)
  </span> 
  
  <span class= "point">
  • bonus(this means that they prioritise their needs

         overreact when they aren't)

     what they want which oftentimes leds to their

     • •Prioritising their needs first (being assertive)is actually an important part towards curing
